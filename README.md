# Project Overview
This project assignment focused on suggesting the most favorable airplane make for our company based on data from aviation accidents from NTSB aviation_data.csv

# Business Understanding
In this data set, we opted to suggest the most favorable planes based on safety and engine type (to help determine how far a plane could fly)

# Data Understanding
We used 3 columns from the total 31 columns in the original dataset. These were 'Make' for the aircraft make, 'Total Fatal Injuries' for the total number of passengers who succumbed and 'Engine.Type' for the engine types that the planes had.

We used both pandas to read and save our data and matplotlib + seaborn to visualize the data.

Finally we used both descriptive analysis and visualizations to draw conclusions.

We have demonstrated 2 charts that we find useful to demonstrate our findings to our company.


# Data Conclusion
From our data set, we were able to suggest the most safe planes to be bought by our company.
